## 🤔 Making the Switch from VS Code

If you're coming from VS Code, here are some tips to ease the transition:

1. Press `Space` to access Which-Key and discover available commands
2. Use Alpha dashboard (startup screen) to access common actions
3. Learn basic Vim motions (`h`,`j`,`k`,`l`, `w`, `b`, etc.) to move efficiently
4. Use Telescope with `<Space>ff` for the familiar Quick Open experience
5. Try `<Space>a` commands to access AI features like Copilot

## 📚 Documentation

For more detailed documentation on all features and keyboard shortcuts, check the comments within each configuration file or use Which-Key in Neovim by pressing the space bar.
