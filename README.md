## 🤔 Making the Switch from VS Code

If you're coming from VS Code, here are some tips to ease the transition:

1. Start with key mappings in normal mode (check out `lua/core/mappings.lua`)
2. Learn the basics of Vim motions to move efficiently
3. Use the dashboard (Alpha) to access common actions
4. Press `<Space>` to see available commands with Which-key
5. Use Telescope (`<Space>ff`) to find files, similar to VS Code's Quick Open
