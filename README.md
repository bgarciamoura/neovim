## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites

- Git
- A Nerd Font installed and configured in your terminal
- Internet connection for downloading packages

### Automatic Installation

We provide two installation scripts that handle everything automatically:

1. **`install-neovim.sh`**: Installs Neovim and core tools (Node.js, MISE, PNPM, Angular CLI)
2. **`install-neovim-deps.sh`**: Installs language servers, linters, formatters, and other tools

```bash
# Download the installation scripts
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgarciamoura/neovim/main/install-neovim.sh
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgarciamoura/neovim/main/install-neovim-deps.sh

# Make them executable
chmod +x install-neovim.sh install-neovim-deps.sh

# Run the main installation script
bash ./install-neovim.sh
```

The scripts will:
- Detect your operating system (macOS, Ubuntu/Debian, or Windows with WSL2)
- Install Neovim with the appropriate method for your system
- Set up MISE (modern version manager) for Node.js
- Install development tools like PNPM and Angular CLI (optional)
- Clone this Neovim configuration
- Install language servers, linters, and formatters
- Configure everything automatically

### Cross-Platform Support

#### macOS
- Automatically installs Homebrew if needed
- Installs Neovim nightly build for latest features
- Sets up environment for Apple Silicon or Intel processors

#### Ubuntu/Debian Linux
- Adds Neovim PPA for latest stable version
- Installs necessary dependencies from apt
- Sets up environment and tools appropriately

#### Windows
- Guides through WSL2 installation if needed
- Sets up Ubuntu on WSL2
- Installs all necessary components in the Linux environment

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually:

```bash
# 1. Install Neovim (version 0.9.0 or later)
# macOS: brew install --HEAD neovim
# Ubuntu: add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/stable && apt-get update && apt-get install neovim

# 2. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bgarciamoura/neovim ~/.config/nvim

# 3. Install dependencies manually
# - Node.js (LTS version recommended)
# - Python with pynvim package
# - Various LSP servers (typescript-language-server, lua-language-server, etc.)
# - Linters and formatters (eslint, prettier, stylua, etc.)

# 4. Start Neovim (plugins will install automatically)
nvim
```

## ‚å®Ô∏è Key Features vs. VS Code

| Feature | This Neovim Config | VS Code |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Startup Time** | Lightning fast (<100ms with diagnostics) | Several seconds |
| **Memory Usage** | Minimal (~100MB) | Heavy (500MB+) |
| **AI Integration** | Enhanced Copilot with better suggestions | Standard GitHub Copilot |
| **Performance Analytics** | Built-in diagnostics for plugins & startup | Limited extension profiling |

## ü§î Making the Switch from VS Code

If you're coming from VS Code, here are some tips to ease the transition:

1. Press `Space` to access Which-Key and discover available commands
2. Use Alpha dashboard (startup screen) to access common actions
3. Learn basic Vim motions (`h`,`j`,`k`,`l`, `w`, `b`, etc.) to move efficiently
4. Use Telescope with `<Space>ff` for the familiar Quick Open experience
5. Try `<Space>a` commands to access AI features like Copilot

## üìö Documentation

For more detailed documentation on all features and keyboard shortcuts, check the comments within each configuration file or use Which-Key in Neovim by pressing the space bar.
